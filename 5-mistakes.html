        <h1>5 Content Marketing Mistakes Costing You Leads</h1>
        <div class="meta">Published: February 8, 2026 | Reading time: 6 minutes</div>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p>You're creating content. Maybe lots of it. But are your readers becoming customers?</p>
            <p>Most content creators make the same mistakes that keep them stuck—spinning their wheels without seeing real conversions. Here are the 5 biggest ones, and how to fix them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake">
            <h2>1. Publishing Without a Defined Audience</h2>
            <p>You write blog posts about "everything." You think broader reach = more conversions. But the opposite is true.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Without a specific audience, your message is diluted. A content creator reading about email marketing doesn't care about your thoughts on video editing. You get visitors, not customers.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> Define your primary audience in one sentence. Example: "I help solo content creators save 5 hours per week on content production." Everything else flows from that.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake">
            <h2>2. Ignoring Email From Day One</h2>
            <p>Your blog gets 500 monthly visitors. Zero email subscribers. Sound familiar?</p>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> You're building on someone else's platform (Reddit, social media, etc.). One algorithm change and you lose access to your audience. Email is yours.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> Add a simple email capture form to every piece of content. Offer something irresistible: a checklist, a template, a quick guide. Start collecting from day one.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake">
            <h2>3. Writing Without a Clear Goal</h2>
            <p>Blog posts that end with "thanks for reading." That's it. No next step.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Reader engagement ≠ conversions. You need each post to do ONE job: get the email, drive to a product, answer a specific question. Vague content = vague results.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> Before writing, define the post's goal:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> This post teaches something valuable (builds trust)</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest:</strong> This post shows them there's a better way (introduces your solution)</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> This post removes objections and asks for the sale</li>
                </ul>
                Map each piece to your funnel.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake">
            <h2>4. Neglecting Repurposing (Leaving Money on the Table)</h2>
            <p>You write a 2,000-word guide. It gets shared once on LinkedIn. Then it sits.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> You're spending 4 hours creating content and 30 minutes promoting it. That math doesn't work. One piece of content should reach multiple channels and formats.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> One piece = multiple formats:
                <ul>
                    <li>Blog post → Email sequence → LinkedIn carousel → Twitter thread</li>
                    <li>Video script → Blog post → YouTube → Podcast episode</li>
                    <li>Case study → Social posts → Webinar → Sales page copy</li>
                </ul>
                5x the reach. Same effort.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake">
            <h2>5. Not Tracking What Works</h2>
            <p>You publish consistently. You have no idea which topics drive sign-ups, which posts get shares, or where your customers come from.</p>
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Without data, you're guessing. You can't optimize. You keep making the same content mistakes because you don't know they're mistakes.</p>
            <div class="fix">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> Track three things:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Views:</strong> Which topics attract readers?</li>
                    <li><strong>Signups:</strong> Which posts convert to emails?</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Where do people spend the most time?</li>
                </ul>
                Review monthly. Double down on what works.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
        <p>Content marketing works. But only when it's deliberate.</p>
        <p>Start with one fix. Define your audience. Add email capture. Repurpose one piece of content. Track one metric. Small changes compound.</p>
        <p>The creators who win aren't making fewer mistakes—they're learning from them faster.</p>
